        <div class="Text">
            <div class="body3">Looking at the homepage on a mobile device, with over 50% of site traffic on mobile devices we can see a huge usability issue right off the bat. The hamburger menu is centered and although it is within the thumb range & easy to navigate to it isn't consistent and involves the Recognition vs Recall heuristic which may lead to a confused user. We were really overwhelmed with lack of informational architecture & user control & freedom because although there is good information on the homepage after scrolling many times the user looses the navigation tab & doesn't have an option to quickly go back to the top of the screen. ​</div>

                <li class="body3">Other than the big "Donate" button at the top of the screen, there is no great call to action while reading through the homepage. </li> 
                <li class="body3">Doesn't have a way to donate to an specific elder need on the homepage (food runs, flour, firewood, etc) </li> 
                <li class="body3">Homepage does not link to a "learn more" or "get involved" under "adopt an elder" section. </li> 
                <li class="body3">Mobile version is takes to much screen space above the fold.

                <li class="body3"> We found that over 50% of users were using their phones to access our user tests. I realized this was an issue when we only designed for desktop and so I designed my wireframes to be scalable from mobile to desktop.</li>
