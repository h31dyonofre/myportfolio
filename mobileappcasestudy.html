    <div class="Text">
        <div class="body3">We reached out to users already on the app to gather user insights, pain points and goals on the HappyCow app. By creating a google form test for users around the world, my partner and I began to send it out through HappyCow social media groups and within the app chat feature. We narrowed down our results and created a user persona. </div>

        <li class="body3">Users on the app travel to different cities frequently.</li>

    <div class="body3">My parnter and I created a priority matrix which has all of our brainstorming results and analyzes what will have the highest user value while maintaining low efforts to achieve the perfect focus for HappyCow.</div>

        <li class="body3">Including a menu in-app keeps users from bouncing to browsers and the app.</li> 
        <li class="body3">Implementing a “Call/Order” button on the app creates an efficient way to complete the users task. </li> 
        <li class="body3">Creating drop down options to view more or less information will keep the app minimal and clean. </li>

    <div class="body3">We began the wireframing process by creating sketches of our ideal user flow, mainly focusing on easing the order process and creating an all in one app experience.</div>

    <img class="artifacts" src="/images/sketches.png">

    <div class="body3">The next step was to create our digital wireframes, we used our wireframes to give us a better understanding of the user flow, ease of use and functionality of the app. We used these wirefames to test users.</div>

    <div class="body3">We tested users throughout this entire process, we found that including the menu in app is an expectation of users. The feature felt natural to click on and didn’t raise concern because users were familiar with this feature on other apps already. </div>

        <li class="body3">Desiging a simple layout can help users by removing unwanted or un-related objects from the layout. </li> 
        <li class="body3">Creating quick sketches at the beggining of the prototyping process can help generate multiple ideas that can be used to create a/b testing.</li> 

        <li class="body3">Testing your prototype is crucial in the design process and showing the progress of the test is helpful for users who tend to over complicate questions or tasks.</li>
